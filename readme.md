RDC-Analysis
=============

_For a description of the RDC project, please read : [RDC - République Démocratique du Cinéma](https://github.com/McFreely/mcfreely.github.com/blob/master/_posts_origin/2013-03-10-Republique-Democratique-du-Cinema.md#rdc---about)_

This is a basic implementation of the classifier.
It's a simple Naive Bayes classifier. I'll later also implement a bag of words feature extractor that use negated words.
This "combo" seems to be the most rewarding with regards to the compromise of ease of implementation to precision of analysis.


But for the moment, this shall be enough.
